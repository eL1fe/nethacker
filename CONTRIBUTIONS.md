# Role router (eL1fe)

Every game is played by one complete bot written by others, chosen by the character's role; all
credit for those engines belongs to their authors (see `influences`). Ours are the router, the
routing table below (measured on eL1fe's held-out multi-role benchmark: paired games, fresh seeds)
and the fixes listed at the end.

Default engine: `dag69` (github.com/daglar-dragomirov/nethacker@69baf4943e2f47a23715b3814438b180c3c64b75:
vkurenkov's jawfish 21e6539 with the castle crossing, plus daglar's additions)

- Healer (human): `vlom8b4` (github.com/vlomshakov/nethacker@8b492ce95e6988b0eae2de84aef1379f885a1306), +3.7 points over 96 paired
  human Healer games against the previous router
- Healer/gnome: `dagfc5` (github.com/daglar-dragomirov/nethacker@fc50360e721e98e5a322dbd6282c703718bd4d46)
- Samurai: `jawfish` (github.com/vkurenkov/nethacker@f15bb8c8e01d905d1946e32bfd2558e17394eab6)
- Tourist: `kefirski` (github.com/kefirski/nethacker@314507ee72fcedf3749b6e2b4d60330bc159e88f)

## eL1fe's fixes in the router

- the role is read from the Xp 1 rank title in the status line ("Agent the Rambler") when the welcome
  line is missing (a full or new moon message can replace it), instead of falling back to the default
  engine

## eL1fe's fixes in the engines

Every engine:

- never wield darts, shuriken, boomerangs, arrows or bolts for melee: a Tourist bashed with its +2
  darts and never threw one

`dag69` (every role not listed above):

- healing spells: AutoAscend never parsed the spell list, so no role ever cast healing; now a Healer,
  or a Monk or Wizard that knows healing, casts it at low HP
- Wizards cast force bolt, their starting attack spell, on a clear line (the fight heuristic only
  meleed; ported from CleverShovel 0d1fb22), never into a shop or shop stock: the bolt flies on
  past its target and breaks potions
- `cast()` answered "In what direction?" with calc_direction's string: 'ne' is two keys and 'n' is
  the vi-key for south-east, so every directional cast went wrong; it now sends the compass action
- no casting while Stressed ("Your concentration falters while carrying so much stuff", a lost turn)
- a known scroll of magic mapping is read from Dlvl 3 when no stairs down are known
- Sokoban desync, phantom altars, dragon-scale parsing, cockatrice touch guard, stoning cure,
  no shop-door kicks, trees unwalkable
